Thank you for your interest in my website. The protection of your privacy is very important to me. Below I inform you in detail about the handling of your data.

## 1. Access data and hosting

You can visit my websites without providing any personal information. Each time you call up a website, the web server only automatically saves a so-called server log file, which contains, for example, the name of the requested file, your IP address, the date and time of the call, the amount of data transferred and the requesting provider (access data) and documents the call. This site is hosted by [DigitalOcean, LLC](https://www.digitalocean.com/legal/data-processing-agreement), so the transfer of data underlies their terms.

## 2. Data collection and use for contract processing

I collect personal data when you provide it to me in the context of your order or when contacting me (e.g. via contact form or e-mail). Mandatory fields are marked as such, because in these cases I need the data to process the contract, or to process your contact and you can not complete the order or send the contact without their information. Which data is collected, can be seen from the respective input forms. I use the data provided by you in accordance with article 6 paragraph 1 of the GPDR.

## 3. Data transfer

For the fulfillment of the contract in accordance with article 6 paragraph 1b GPDR, I may pass on your data to a mail company commissioned with a delivery, insofar as this is necessary for the delivery of ordered goods. Depending on which payment service provider you use, I pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by me for the processing of payments.

## 4. Cookies and web analysis

In order to make the visit to my website attractive and to enable the use of certain functions, to display suitable products or for market research, I use so-called cookies on various pages. This serves to protect my legitimate interests in an optimized presentation of my offer, which prevail in the context of a balancing of interests, in accordance with article 6 paragraph 1f of the GPDR. Cookies are small text files that are automatically stored on your terminal device. Some of the cookies I use are deleted at the end of the browser session, i.e. after you close your browser (so-called session cookies). Others are stored for a longer time by your browser and expire after a pre-set time interval.

## 5. Social media plugins

### Use of social plugins

So-called social plugins ("plugins") from social networks are used on my website.

When you call up a page of my website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the servers of Facebook, Google, or Microsoft. The content of the plugin is transmitted directly to your browser by the respective provider and integrated into the page. By integrating the plugins, the providers receive the information that your browser has called up the corresponding page of my website, even if you do not have a profile or are not currently logged in. This information (including your IP address) is sent from your browser directly to a server of the respective provider.

### My online presence social media platforms

My presence on social networks and platforms serves to improve active communication with my customers and interested parties. I inform there about my products and ongoing special promotions.

When visiting my online presences on social media, your data may be used for market research and advertising purposes.
